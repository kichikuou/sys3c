= Unicode mode

This document explains how to use sys3c to translate games into
languages other than Japanese or English. To run such translated games,
https://github.com/kichikuou/xsystem35-sdl2[xsystem35] is required.

== The `unicode` option

Normally, strings in AliceSoft's scenario files are stored in CP932, a Japanese
character encoding used in Windows (it also covers English letters). sys3c's
`unicode` option allows you to output a scenario file in UTF-8 character
encoding. The generated scenario does not work on the original System 3.x, but
it works on xsystem35 and in which you can use languages other than Japanese or
English.

== Translation workflow

1. Decompile the game with xref:sys3dc.adoc[`sys3dc`].
2. Open `sys3c.cfg` file in the `decompiled` folder, and add the following
   line:

     unicode = true

3. Build the scenario file with xref:sys3c.adoc[`sys3c`]. The generated
   scenario file has the same contents as the original, but is encoded in
   UTF-8.
4. Overwrite the original scenario file with the generated one (don't forget to
   back up the original file), and run it with `xsystem35`. It should just work
   as before. (If not, report a bug!)
5. Now you can put strings in the source files, in any languages. Modify the
   source files and repeat the steps 3-4.

== Fonts

The fonts come with xsystem35 only cover Japanese, so you will need to prepare a
font for your language.

If you are translating from Japanese, it would be useful to have a font that
covers both Japanese and your language while translating.
http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html[GNU Unifont] is a good candidate,
which is used in the example at the top of this document.

To change the font in xsystem35, put the font files (`.ttf` or `.otf`) in the
game folder (where `*.ALD` files are), and create a file named `.xsys35rc` in
the same folder with the following contents (replace the file names):

  ttfont_gothic: your-sans-serif-font.ttf
  ttfont_mincho: your-serif-font.ttf
